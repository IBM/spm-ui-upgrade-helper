# Overview

The SPM UI Upgrade Helper is a tool that takes the changes we have made to the SPM styling and applies those same changes to a customer's custom stylesheets. This automates the upgrade process.

A web interface is available from which the tools can be run and the output displayed.

To get started, see the [UI Upgrade Helper guide](ui_upgrade_helper_guide.md).
