title: Install and run the tool
---

The UI Upgrade Helper is available for customers from SPM Software Downloads on [Merative Support](https://merative.my.site.com/mysupport/s/).

You must be a technical contact to download software, open a support case if you need access. Select **SPM Software Download** and enter your technical contact credentials to download the software. 

The UI Upgrade Helper is available as an internal download for Merative employees.

Complete the following steps to install, configure, and run the tool and to review and implement any required changes.

1. Download `spm-ui-upgrade-helper.tar`.
2. Load the Docker images:

   Windows ™️

   `docker load <./spm-ui-upgrade-helper.tar`

   Linux ®️

   `docker load <./spm-ui-upgrade-helper.tar`

3. Open Docker Desktop and check for the following images.

4. Download the docker-compose.yml file:

   Windows ™️

   `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merative/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml`
  
   Linux ®️

   `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merative/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml`

5. Run `chmod -R 777 <output_folder>` so that Docker can interact with the temporary output folder. For example, `C:\temp\upgrade` or `/tmp/upgrade`.
6. Set the required variables:

   <InlineNotification>

   Warning:  Do not point the output folder at your version 8 development environment as it is a temporary folder that is wiped each time that the UI Upgrade Helper runs.

   </InlineNotification>

  Windows ™️

   ```batch
   Set INPUT_FOLDER=`<input_folder>`
   Set OUTPUT_FOLDER=`<output_folder>`
   Set VERSION=`<version>`
   ```

  Linux ®️

  ```bash
  export INPUT_FOLDER=`<input_folder>`
  export OUTPUT_FOLDER=`<output_folder>`
  export VERSION=`<version>` 
  ```

  Where:

   - `VERSION` is the version of the tool on DockerHub -typically `latest`.
   - `INPUT_FOLDER` is the absolute path to the input files for the tool. Typically this is the Social Program Management installation folder, which by default is `C:\IBM\Curam\Development` or `opt/IBM/Curam/Development`.
   - `OUTPUT_FOLDER` is the absolute path to your temporary output folder. For example, `C:\temp\upgrade` or `/tmp/upgrade`.
7. Run the Docker compose file.

  Windows ™️

   ```batch
  docker-compose up --no-build 
   ```

  Linux ®️

  ```bash
   docker-compose up --no-build 
  ```

  In Docker Desktop, you can see the running containers.

   ![1. Press F1, 2. Type "Run SPM UI Upgrade Helper", 3. Select the shortcut, 4. Wait for the tool to finish, 5. Click "Source Control: Git" to see the output](../../images/upgrade-helper.gif "Running the UI Upgrade Helper tool")

8. For more information about Window Size Tool changes, see [Reviewing Window Size Tool changes](../../setup/tools#reviewing-window-size-tool-changes).
9.  When you are happy with the changes, copy the contents of the `output` folder into your v8 development environment.
10. Build and test your v8 development environment.

## Errors

Docker container logs are available in the console, or by using `docker logs spm-ui-upgrade-helper`.

You can save the logs to a file. For example, by using `docker logs spm-ui-upgrade-helper > /tmp/logs.txt`.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that you are logged in to Docker, (run `docker login`).
- Ensure that the correct folders are shared in Docker Desktop.
- Restart Docker Desktop.
- Delete the `<output_folder>` and try again.
- Make sure you have run `chmod -R 777 <output_folder>` so that Docker can write to it.
- Don't refresh [http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace/output](http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace/output), but go to [http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace](http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace).
- To kill the Docker container, use `docker stop spm-ui-upgrade-helper` followed by `docker rm spm-ui-upgrade-helper`.
