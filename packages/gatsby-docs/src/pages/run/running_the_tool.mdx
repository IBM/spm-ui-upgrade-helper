title: Running the tool
---

Complete the following steps to configure and run the tool and to review and implement any required changes.

1. Run `docker login`.

2. Download the appropriate batch file or shell script for your environment:

   Windows ™️

   `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat -o spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat`

   Linux ®️
   
   `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh -o spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh`

3. (Linux®️ only) Make the shell script executable with `chmod +x spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh`

4. Download the docker-compose.yml file:

   Windows ™️

   `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml`
  
   Linux ®️
   
   `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml`

5. Run `chmod -R 777 <output_folder>` so that Docker can interact with the temporary output folder. For example, `C:\temp\upgrade` or `/tmp/upgrade`.

6. Set the required variables and run the batch file or shell script:

   <InlineNotification>

   Warning:  Do not point the output folder at your version 8 development environment. This temporary folder is wiped each time that the UI Upgrade Helper runs.

   </InlineNotification>

  Windows ™️

   ```batch
   Set INPUT_FOLDER=`<input_folder>`
   Set OUTPUT_FOLDER=`<output_folder>`
   Set VERSION=`<version>`
   spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat
   ```

  Linux ®️

  ```bash
  export INPUT_FOLDER=`<input_folder>
  export OUTPUT_FOLDER=`<output_folder>`
  export VERSION=`<version>` 
  sh spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh
  ```

  Where:

   - `VERSION` is the version of the tool on DockerHub - typically `latest`.
   - `INPUT_FOLDER` is the absolute path to the input files for the tool. Typically this is the Social Program Management installation folder, which by default is `C:\IBM\Curam\Development` or `opt/IBM/Curam/Development`.
   - `OUTPUT_FOLDER` is the absolute path to your temporary output folder. For example, `C:\temp\upgrade` or `/tmp/upgrade`.

## Run the tool and review the changes

1. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace](http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace).
4. Press the F1 key or Cmd + Shift + p.
5. Type "Run SPM UI Upgrade Helper" and click on the shortcut. The files in the `input` folder are scanned and the results are placed in the `output` folder.
6. Wait a few minutes for the tool to finish.
7. Click the `Source Control: Git` button on the left sidebar to inspect the changes.

   ![1. Press F1, 2. Type "Run SPM UI Upgrade Helper", 3. Select the shortcut, 4. Wait for the tool to finish, 5. Click "Source Control: Git" to see the output](../../images/upgrade-helper.gif "Running the UI Upgrade Helper tool")

8. For more information about Window Size Tool changes, see [Reviewing Window Size Tool changes](../../setup/tools#reviewing-window-size-tool-changes).
9.  When you are happy with the changes, copy the contents of the `output` folder into your v8 development environment.
10. Build and test your v8 development environment.

## Errors

Docker container logs are available in the console, or by using `docker logs spm-ui-upgrade-helper`.

You can save the logs to a file. For example, by using `docker logs spm-ui-upgrade-helper > /tmp/logs.txt`.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that you are logged in to Docker, (run `docker login`.)
- Ensure that the correct folders are shared in Docker Desktop.
- Restart Docker Desktop.
- Delete  the `<output_folder>` and try again.
- Make sure you have run `chmod -R 777 <output_folder>` so that Docker can write to it.
- Don't refresh [http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace/output](http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace/output), but go to [http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace](http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace).
- To kill the Docker container, use `docker stop spm-ui-upgrade-helper` followed by `docker rm spm-ui-upgrade-helper`.
