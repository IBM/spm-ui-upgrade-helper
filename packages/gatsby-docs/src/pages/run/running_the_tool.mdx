Warning: Remember that the temporary output folder is wiped when the UI Upgrade Helper runs. Do not point it at your v8 environment.

1. Run `chmod -R 777 <output folder>`so that Docker can interact with the temporary output folder. For example, `c:\temp\upgrade` or `/tmp/upgrade`.
2. Run the tool:
    - (Windows ™️) `spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat <version> <input folder> <output folder>` 
    - (Linux ®️) `./spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh <version> <input folder> <output folder>` 
    - Where:
        - `<version>` is typically "latest".
        - `<input folder>` is the absolute path to the root of your 7.0.11.0 development environment.
        - `<output folder>` is the absolute path to your temporary output folder.
2. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000.
3. Press `F1` or `cmd + shift + p`.
4. Type "Run SPM UI Upgrade Helper" and click on the shortcut. The files in `<input folder>` are scanned and the results are placed in `<output folder>`.
5. Wait a few minutes for the tool to finish.
6. Click the `Source Control: Git` button on the left sidebar to inspect the changes.

8. For more information about Window Size Tool changes, see [Reviewing Window Size Tool changes](https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/blob/poraghal-docs-review-WST/packages/gatsby-docs/src/pages/setup/tools.mdx#reviewing-window-size-tool-changes).
9. When you are happy with the changes, copy the contents of `<output folder>` into your v8 development environment.
10. Build and test v8.

## Errors

Docker container logs are available in the console, or by using `docker logs spm-ui-upgrade-helper`.

You can save the logs to a file. For example, by using `docker logs spm-ui-upgrade-helper > /tmp/logs.txt`.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you are logged in to Docker (run `docker login`.)
- Make sure folders are shared in Docker Desktop.
- Restart Docker Desktop.
- Delete `<output folder>` and try again.
- Make sure you have run `chmod -R 777 <output folder>` so that Docker can write to it.
- Don't refresh http://localhost:3000/#/home/workspace/output, instead go to http://localhost:3000.
- To kill the Docker container use `docker stop spm-ui-upgrade-helper` followed by `docker rm spm-ui-upgrade-helper`.
