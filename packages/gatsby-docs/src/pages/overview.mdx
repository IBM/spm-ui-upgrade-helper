Use the UI Upgrade helper to help you to upgrade the IBM Social Program Management UI from version 7 to version 8.

The SPM UI Upgrade Helper is a suite of tools that can identify required version 8 changes to CSS, modals, and icons in your version 7 development environment. You can review the suggested changes in the output of the tools and apply the appropriate changes to your version 8 development environment.

In addition, for detailed instructions on manually updating Social Program Management font-faces, see [Manually updating fonts](customer/customer_font_replacement).
