Use the SPM UI Upgrade helper to help you to upgrade the IBM Social Program Management UI from version 7 to version 8.

The SPM UI Upgrade Helper is a suite of tools that can apply changes that are needed to CSS and icons for version 8 to your version 7 development environment. You can review the output of the tools and apply the appropriate changes to your version 8 development environment.

In addition, for detailed instructions on manually updating Social Program Management font-faces, see [Manually updating fonts](customer/customer_font_replacement).
