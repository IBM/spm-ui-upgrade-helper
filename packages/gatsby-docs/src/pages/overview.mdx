To help you to upgrade to the new IBM Social Program Management v8.0 UI, you can use the SPM UI Upgrade helper for your CSS and icon updates.

The SPM UI Upgrade Helper is a suite of tools that help to automate the UI upgrade process by identifying v8 changes in a 7.0.11.0 development environment.

In addition, for detailed instructions on manually updating Social Program Management font-faces, see [Manually updating fonts](customer/customer_font_replacement).
