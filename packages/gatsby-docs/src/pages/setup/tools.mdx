You can run all of the tools sequentially with a single command or run the window sizing tool separately.

### CSS Rules Tool

Scans customer stylesheets and updates the CSS selectors to match the changes made when moving to the Carbon Design System.

- Iterates over customer CSS files and applies the rules codified in [packages/css-rules-tool/rules/*.json](https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/tree/main/packages/css-rules-tool/rules).

Example rules file:

    {
      "SelectorRemove": [
        { "value": ".delete-this-selector" },
        { "value": ".delete-this-selector .and-this" }
        { "value": ".delete-this-selector .and-this-as-well" }
      ],
      "SelectorReplace": [
        {
          "value": ".foo .qux",
          "newValue": ".bar .qux"
        }
      ]
    }

All of the values in `SelectorRemove` are deleted. The values in `SelectorReplace` are replaced by `newValue`.

#### Ordering of rules

The following steps determine the order of the rules:

- All OOTB rules are loaded.
- The rules are sorted by length, with the longest items first, inside each of their respective categories `SelectorRemove` and `SelectorReplace`.
- The `SelectorRemove` rules are applied first, followed by the `SelectorReplace` rules.

### Window Size Tool

Coming soon
<!--
Scans customer UIM files and updates the width of modals that are either too wide or too narrow based on their content.

- Iterates over customer UIM files and applies the rules codified in [packages/window-size-tool/rules.json](https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/tree/main/packages/window-size-tool/rules.json).
- Any given UIM file will only match with one rule, so rule order matters.

Example rules file:

    // Find UIMs that have a width of 576px or lower, and contains a 2 column CLUSTER or a 4 column LIST, and update it's width to 'md'.

    {
      "width": "<= 576",
      "terms": [
        "//CLUSTER/@NUM_COLS = 2",
        "count(//LIST/*) = 4"
      ],
      "target": "md"
    }

The `width` expression is used to determine which UIM files to match against (the tool is inspecting the `WINDOW_OPTIONS` attribute of any `<PAGE>` or `<LINK>` elements it finds).

The `terms` array defines [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) expressions that are run against each UIM file that matches the `width` expression. If any of the expressions evaluated to `true` the size of that UIM is updated.

The `target` value is the new [Carbon modal size](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/style#sizes) category that should be applied to the modal if the `width` and any of the `terms` evaluate to `true`. The pixel values for each size category are codified in [packages/window-size-tool/sizes.js](https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/tree/main/packages/window-size-tool/sizes.js).

### Icon Replacer Tool

Scans customer source files for `V7` icons that have been replaced by `V8` equivalents.

- Iterates over customer source files and replaces the icons codified in [packages/icon-replacer-tool/icons_mappings.json](https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/tree/main/packages/icon-replacer-tool/icon_mappings.json).

Example icons mappings (`"v7_FILENAME":"V8_FILENAME"`):

    {
      "Actions_Blue30_20px.png": "overflow-menu-horizontal--20-on-dark.svg",
      "Actions_Blue50_20px.png": "overflow-menu-horizontal--20-enabled.svg",
      "Calendar_Blue50_20px.png": "calendar--20-enabled.svg",
      "Day_Blue50_20px.png": "calendar__day--20-enabled.svg",
      "Gotodate_Blue50_20px.png": "calendar__go-to-date--20-enabled.svg",
    }

Example `V8` icon files:

    `/source_files/overflow-menu-horizontal--20-on-dark.svg`

All `V7` icon files that are found are deleted and their `V8` equivalents are copied to the same location.

References to the icon in customer source files (files such as `.css`, `.js`, `jspx`, etc.) are also updated.
