   **Note:** In Social Program Management 8.1, Carbon was updated from v10 to v11. In Carbon v11, the CSS class name prefix "bx" was changed to "cds". For example, `bx--cluster` was changed to `cds--cluster`. If you are upgrading to Social Program Management 8.1 or later and have custom code, you must review your CSS to see if you are affected.

Complete the following steps to prepare a development environment to run the tools, and to install and configure the required software

   **Note:** The UI Upgrade helper is designed to help with an upgrade from Social Program Management v7 to v8 only. Do not use to upgrade from v7 to a more recent release of v7.

## Initial setup

1. Set up a v7 development environment with your custom changes, which provides the input data for the tool.
2. Decide on a temporary output folder, where you can review the suggested changes.
3. Set up a v8.0.0 or later development environment, where you can manually apply and test the updates. For v8.1 or later, ensure that you review the CSS in your custom code as per the note above.
4. Install Docker Desktop for [Windows ™️](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
5. Install [curl](https://curl.se/download.html).

## Configuring Docker Desktop

After you install Docker Desktop, you must configure it to provide access to input and output folders for the tool on the local file system:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Click Settings > Resources > File Sharing.
3. Share the Social Program Management v7 source code folder that contains the input data. Typically this is the Social Program Management installation folder, which by default is  `C:\IBM\Curam\Development` or `opt/IBM/Curam/Development`.
4. Share a temporary output folder to write the modified data. For example,  `c:\temp\upgrade` or `/tmp/upgrade`.

Warning: Do not point the output folder at your v8 development environment. This temporary folder is wiped each time that the UI Upgrade Helper runs.

![1. Open Docker Desktop, 2. Click the Settings button then Resources then File Sharing, 3. Add the folder you want to share with the Docker container](../../images/docker-volume-sharing.png "Docker volume sharing screenshot")

## Ignoring files

Assuming a standard IBM Social Program Management v7 installation, in most cases you can run the tools without modification. However, if your installation is nonstandard, you might need to ignore certain files and folders.

You can ignore any files that you do not want to be affected by the tool by creating a file called `.spm-uiuh-ignore` that contains folders or patterns to ignore.

For more information about default folders, see [The Cúram application and CDEJ installation folders](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=environment-cram-application-cdej-installation-folders) and the [Server application folder structure](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=application-directory-structure).

Place the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file in the input folder of your v7 development environment.

The file follows the same rules as a [.gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file. All paths are relative to the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file location.

An example .spm-uiuh-ignore file is shown.

    # Ignore files in the following folders
    /EJBServer/components/Foo
    /EJBServer/components/Bar
    /EJBServer/components/Muk*

    # Ignore .abc and .xyz files:
    **/*.abc
    **/*.xyz

## The `.spm-uiuh-config` file

If you need to further customize the tool for your specific environment, you can override some of the default configuration by creating a `.spm-uiuh-config` file in the root of your v7 development environment.

The file contents should be JSON and must match the structure of the [default configuration](https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/blob/main/packages/shared-utils/src/config.js). You only need to include the items you wish to override.

Paths are relative to the input folder. An example `s.spm-uiuh-config file` is shown.

    {
      // Globs are relative to the input folder
      globs: [ "**/*" ],
      // Log verbosity. Options are quiet/normal/debug.
      logLevel: "debug",
      // Folder where CSS rules are located
      cssRulesTool: {
        rulesFolder: "custom-rules",
      },
      iconReplacerTool: {
        // File extensions to exclude when checking for icon references
        exclude: ["zip", "class", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "png"],
        // Directory containing v8 icon files
        iconFolder: "./source_files",
        // File containing icon mappings from v7 to v8
        iconMappings: "./icon_mappings.json",
      },
      // Window sizing rules
      windowSizeTool: {
        rules: "../window-size-tool/rules.json",
      }
    }
