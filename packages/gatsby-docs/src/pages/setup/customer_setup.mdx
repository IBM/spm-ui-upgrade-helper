title: Setting up the tools
---

Complete the following steps to install and configure the required software, and to prepare a development environment to run the tools. 

Assuming a standard Social Program Management installation, in most cases you can run the tools without modification. However, if your installation is non-standard, you might need to ignore certain files and folder.

## Initial setup

1. Set up a 7.0.11.0 development environment with your custom changes, which provide the input data.
2. Set up an 8.0.0 or later development environment, to apply the updates.
3. Install Docker Desktop for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
4. Install [curl](https://curl.se/download.html).

## Configuring Docker Desktop

After installation, you must configure Docker Desktop to provide access to folders on the local file system that are needed by the tools. 

- The Social Program Management source code folder that provides the input data. 
- An temporary output folder to write the modified data. This temporary folder is wiped each time the UI Upgrade Helper runs.



1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Click Settings > Resources > File Sharing.
3. Share your 7.0.11.0 development environment folder.
4. Share a temporary output folder, e.g. `/tmp/upgrade` or `c:\temp\upgrade`
    - Warning: Do not point at your v8 development environment. This temporary folder is wiped when the UI Upgrade Helper runs.

![1. Open Docker Desktop, 2. Click the Settings button then Resources then File Sharing, 3. Add the folder you want to share with the Docker container](../../images/docker-volume-sharing.png "Docker volume sharing screenshot")

## Downloading the tool

1. Run `docker login`
2. Download the batch file or shell script:
    - `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat -o spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat` (Windows)
    - `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh -o spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh` (Linux)
3. For Linux, make the shell script executable with `chmod +x spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh`


## Ignoring files

You can ignore files that you do not want to be affected by the tool by creating a file called `.spm-uiuh-ignore` that contains the patterns to ignore. 

Place the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file in the root of your 7.0.11.0 development environment.

The file follows the same rules as a [.gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file. All paths are relative to the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file location.

## Example .spm-uiuh-ignore file

    # Ignore files in the following folders
    /EJBServer/components/Foo
    /EJBServer/components/Bar
    /EJBServer/components/Muk*

    # Ignore .abc and .xyz files:
    **/*.abc
    **/*.xyz
