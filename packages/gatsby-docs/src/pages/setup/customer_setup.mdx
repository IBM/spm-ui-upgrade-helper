title: Setting up the tools
---

Complete the following steps to install and configure the required software, and to prepare a development environment to run the tools. 

Assuming a standard IBM Social Program Management installation, in most cases you can run the tools without modification. However, if your installation is non-standard, you might need to ignore certain files and folder.

## Initial setup

1. Set up a 7.0.11.0 development environment with your custom changes, which provides the input data for the tool.
2. Decide on a temporary output folder, where you can review the suggested changes.
3. Set up an 8.0.0 or later development environment, where you can manually apply and test the updates.
4. Install Docker Desktop for [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
5. Install [curl](https://curl.se/download.html).

## Configuring Docker Desktop

After installation, you must configure Docker Desktop to provide access to certain folders on the local file system. 

- The Social Program Management 7.0.11.0 source code folder that provides the input data. 
- An temporary output folder to write the modified data, which is wiped each time you run the UI Upgrade Helper.

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Click Settings > Resources > File Sharing.
3. Share your 7.0.11.0 development environment folder.
4. Share your temporary output folder.
   
    <InlineNotification>

    Warning: Do not point at your v8 development environment. This temporary folder is wiped when the UI Upgrade Helper runs.

    </InlineNotification>
    
   For example, enter `/tmp/upgrade` or `c:\temp\upgrade`.

![1. Open Docker Desktop, 2. Click the Settings button then Resources then File Sharing, 3. Add the folder you want to share with the Docker container](../../images/docker-volume-sharing.png "Docker volume sharing screenshot")

## Downloading the tool

1. Run `docker login`.
2. Download the batch file or shell script:
    - `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat -o spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat` (Windows)
    - `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh -o spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh` (Linux)
3. For Linux, make the shell script executable with `chmod +x spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh`


## Ignoring files

You can ignore any files that you do not want to be affected by the tool by creating a file called `.spm-uiuh-ignore` that contains the patterns to ignore. 

Place the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file in the root of your 7.0.11.0 development environment.

The file follows the same rules as a [.gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file. All paths are relative to the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file location.

An example .spm-uiuh-ignore file is shown.

    # Ignore files in the following folders
    /EJBServer/components/Foo
    /EJBServer/components/Bar
    /EJBServer/components/Muk*

    # Ignore .abc and .xyz files:
    **/*.abc
    **/*.xyz
