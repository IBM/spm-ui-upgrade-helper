title: Setting up the tools
---

Complete the following steps to prepare a development environment to run the tools, and to install and configure the required software

   Note: The UI Upgrade helper is designed to upgrade to version 8 only, and not to upgrade to a more recent IBM Social Program Management version 7.

Assuming a standard IBM Social Program Management version 7 installation, in most cases you can run the tools without modification. However, if your installation is nonstandard, you might need to ignore certain files and folders.

## Initial setup

1. Set up a version 7 development environment with your custom changes, which provides the input data for the tool. For example, 7.0.11. 
2. Decide on a temporary output folder, where you can review the suggested changes.
3. Set up a version 8.0.0 or later development environment, where you can manually apply and test the updates.
4. Install Docker Desktop for [Windows ™️](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
5. Install [curl](https://curl.se/download.html).

## Configuring Docker Desktop

After installation, you must configure Docker Desktop to provide access to certain folders on the local file system:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Click Settings > Resources > File Sharing.
3. Share the Social Program Management version 7 source code folder that contains the input data. Typically this is the the Social Program Management installation folder, which by default is  `C:\IBM\Curam\Development` or `opt/IBM/Curam/Development`.
4. Share a temporary output folder to write the modified data, which is wiped when the UI Upgrade Helper runs. For example,  `c:\temp\upgrade` or `/tmp/upgrade`.

> Warning: Do not point at your version 8 development environment. This temporary folder is wiped when the UI Upgrade Helper runs.

![1. Open Docker Desktop, 2. Click the Settings button then Resources then File Sharing, 3. Add the folder you want to share with the Docker container](../../images/docker-volume-sharing.png "Docker volume sharing screenshot")

## Downloading the tool

1. Run `docker login`. 


2. Download the batch file or shell script:

   (Windows ™️) `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat -o spm-ui-upgrade-helper.bat`

   (Linux ®️) `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh -o spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh`

3. (Linux ®️) Make the shell script executable with `chmod +x spm-ui-upgrade-helper.sh`


4. Download docker-compose.yml file: 

   (Windows ™️) `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml` 
  
   (Linux ®️) `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml` 


## Ignoring files

You can ignore any files that you do not want to be affected by the tool by creating a file called `.spm-uiuh-ignore` that contains folders or patterns to ignore.

For more information about default folders, see [The Cúram application and CDEJ installation folders](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=environment-cram-application-cdej-installation-folders) and the [Server application folder structure](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=application-directory-structure).

Place the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file in the input folder of your 7.0.11.0 development environment.

The file follows the same rules as a [.gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file. All paths are relative to the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file location.

An example .spm-uiuh-ignore file is shown.

    # Ignore files in the following folders
    /EJBServer/components/Foo
    /EJBServer/components/Bar
    /EJBServer/components/Muk*

    # Ignore .abc and .xyz files:
    **/*.abc
    **/*.xyz

## The `.spm-uiuh-config` file

You can override the default configuration by creating a `.spm-uiuh-config` file in the root of your 7.0.11.0 development environment.

This can be used to customize the tools.

The file contents should be JSON and must match the structure of the [default configuration](https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/blob/main/packages/shared-utils/src/config.js). You only need to include the items you wish to override.

Paths are relative to the input folder. An example .spm-uiuh-config file is shown.

    {
      // Globs are relative to the input folder
      globs: [ "**/*" ],
      // Log verbosity. Options are quiet/normal/debug.
      logLevel: "debug",
      // Folder where CSS rules are located
      cssRulesTool: {
        rulesFolder: "custom-rules",
      },
      iconReplacerTool: {
        // File extensions to exclude when checking for icon references
        exclude: ["zip", "class", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "png"],
        // Directory containing v8 icon files
        iconFolder: "./source_files",
        // File containing icon mappings from v7 to v8
        iconMappings: "./icon_mappings.json",
      },
      // Window sizing rules
      windowSizeTool: {
        rules: "../window-size-tool/rules.json",
      }
    }
