Set up a v7 development environment with your custom changes, which provides the input data for the tool.\n2. Decide on a temporary output folder, where you can review the suggested changes.\n3. Set up a v8.0.0 or later development environment, where you can manually apply and test the updates. For v8.1 or later, ensure that you review the CSS in your custom code as per the note above.\n4. Install Docker Desktop for [Windows ™️](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).\n5. Install [curl](https://curl.se/download.html).\n\n## Configuring Docker Desktop\n\nAfter you install Docker Desktop, you must configure it to provide access to input and output folders for the tool on the local file system:\n\n1. Open Docker Desktop.\n2. Click Settings > Resources > File Sharing.\n3. Share the Social Program Management v7 source code folder that contains the input data. Typically this is the Social Program Management installation folder, which by default is  `C:\\IBM\\Curam\\Development` or `opt/IBM/Curam/Development`.\n4. Share a temporary output folder to write the modified data. For example,  `c:\\temp\\upgrade` or `/tmp/upgrade`.\n\n<InlineNotification>\nWarning: Do not point the output folder at your v8 development environment. This temporary folder is wiped each time that the UI Upgrade Helper runs.\n</InlineNotification>\n\n![1. Open Docker Desktop, 2. Click the Settings button then Resources then File Sharing, 3. Add the folder you want to share with the Docker container](../../images/docker-volume-sharing.png \"Docker volume sharing screenshot\")\n\n## Ignoring files\n\nAssuming a standard IBM Social Program Management v7 installation, in most cases you can run the tools without modification. However, if your installation is nonstandard, you might need to ignore certain files and folders.\n\nYou can ignore any files that you do not want to be affected by the tool by creating a file called `.spm-uiuh-ignore` that contains folders or patterns to ignore.\n\nFor more information about default folders, see [The Cúram application and CDEJ installation folders](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=environment-cram-application-cdej-installation-folders) and the [Server application folder structure](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=application-directory-structure).\n\nPlace the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file in the input folder of your v7 development environment.\n\nThe file follows the same rules as a [.gitignore](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file. All paths are relative to the `.spm-uiuh-ignore` file location.\n\nAn example .spm-uiuh-ignore file is shown.\n\n    # Ignore files in the following folders\n    /EJBServer/components/Foo\n    /EJBServer/components/Bar\n    /EJBServer/components/Muk*\n\n    # Ignore .abc and .xyz files:\n    **/*.abc\n    **/*.xyz\n\n## The `.spm-uiuh-config` file\n\nIf you need to further customize the tool for your specific environment, you can override some of the default configuration by creating a `.spm-uiuh-config` file in the root of your v7 development environment.\n\nThe file contents should be JSON and must match the structure of the [default configuration](https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-upgrade-helper/blob/main/packages/shared-utils/src/config.js). You only need to include the items you wish to override.\n\nPaths are relative to the input folder.
