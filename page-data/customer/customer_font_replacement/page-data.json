Perform a search across  all components for the following. If any references are found in your code base, then you are affected.\n\n- helvetica-neue-ibm.css\n- HelvNeueLightforIBM\n- HelvNeueRomanforIBM\n- HelvNeueMediumforIBM\n- HelvNeueBoldforIBM\n\n## Context of the Change\n\nThese SPM font variables were deprecated in a previous release and are now being removed from the product.\n\n- HelvNeueLightforIBM\n- HelvNeueRomanforIBM\n- HelvNeueMediumforIBM\n- HelvNeueBoldforIBM\n\nAny instances of the above variables in custom code should be replaced with one of the following generic font-faces. Alternatively, one of the unmodifiable infrastructure properties described for Step 2b may be used for non-IEG components. The recommended approach is option 2b for non-IEG components when the font-family specified by IBM is desired.\n\n- MainRegularFontforIBM\n- MainBoldFontforIBM\n\n## How to upgrade\n\nThe following paragraphs detail the checks that should be performed on the customers code base and the changes that may be required. \n\n### Step 1\n\nThe CSS file 'helvetica-neue-ibm.css' has been removed from the below locations. Search for references to this file across all custom pages. Any imports of this file should be replaced with 'main-ibm-font.css'. The new font CSS file ('main-ibm-font.css') will also exist at these locations. \n\n- JDE/CuramCDEJ/lib/curam/web/themes/curam/fonts/\n- Webclient/components/CitizenContextViewer/Context/FlexWidgets/resources/fonts\n\n| Search for             | Replace with      |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------- |\n| helvetica-neue-ibm.css | main-ibm-font.css |\n\n### Step 2\n\nThe following sections detail the approach that should be taken to complete this upgrade. The steps involved in this approach are 'find & replace' tasks. You should consider compiling a list of affected CSS attributes and decide in advance whether the optional step 2b should be implemented before making these changes.\n\n### Step 2a - Using the SPM defined font-faces\n\nThis section details how to update your CSS to use the new SPM font-faces directly. \n\nAll components should be checked for references to the removed values and updated. The following table shows what searches should be made and the appropriate replacement.\n\n| Search for           | Replace with          |\n| -------------------- | --------------------- |\n| HelvNeueLightforIBM  | MainRegularFontforIBM |\n| HelvNeueRomanforIBM  | MainRegularFontforIBM |\n| HelvNeueMediumforIBM | MainRegularFontforIBM |\n| HelvNeueBoldforIBM   | MainBoldFontforIBM    |\n\n### Step 2b - Using internal infrastructure properties\n\nThis section is an optional step that can be made to CSS attributes. These properties can be used instead of the literal SPM font-faces used above in step 2a.  Please note that this option cannot be used for CSS that is applied to IEG pages. For IEG pages use option 2a.\n\nIn implementing this option, you use SPMs internal infrastructure properties to leverage the unmodifiable SPM value for your font family. The advantage of using these properties is that they automatically inherit changes to the SPM font family value, should any changes be made to it in the future.\n\nWhen using these properties, they should replace the entire font-family value rather than only replacing the SPM font-face as done in 2a.\n\nFor example, the following table shows the change needed for a medium weighted font. \n\n| Description | Pre v8.0 update | Post update |\n| ----------- | --------------- | ----------- |\n| Change from literal fonts in the font attribute to inheriting the font family from the internal infrastructure property | font: 15px HelvNeueMediumforIBM,Arial,sans-serif; | font: 15px $infrastructure_main-regular_font-family; |\n| Change from literal fonts in the font-family attribute to inheriting the font family from the internal infrastructure property | font-family: HelvNeueMediumforIBM,Arial,sans-serif; | font-family: $infrastructure_main-regular_font-family;\n\nSee this list of the available weights and properties that can be used in your (non-IEG) CSS.\n\n| Font weight | Template Engine Property for font-family |\n| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Regular     | infrastructure_main-regular_font-family  |\n| Bold        | infrastructure_main-bold_font-family     |\n\n\nThe value for these properties is defined in SPM and should not be changed for any reason as this would remove any future benefit of getting updates to these properties in future SPM releases.\n\n### Verification\n\nOn completion of the above upgrade steps, there should be no instances of the pattern \"HelvNeue*forIBM\" in the CSS associated with the SPM application. In order to verify the changes have been made correctly, load the application pages that use the affected CSS and inspect the affected elements using the browser development tools.\n\nThe font or font-family attributes should now be using one of the new SPM font-faces. \n\nIf you implemented option 2b, then the font or font-family attributes value should be using one of the complete *SPM Font Family* options shown in the table below. \n\n| Weight | Infrastructure Property | SPM Font Family |\n| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------- |\n| Regular | infrastructure_main-regular_font-family | MainRegularFontforIBM, 'Helvetica Neue', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Droid Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif |\n| Bold | infrastructure_main-bold_font-family | MainBoldFontforIBM, 'Helvetica Neue', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Droid Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif |\n\nThese font family values are the SPM values for v8.0 and are subject to change in future releases. For more information about these changes, see the release notes.\n\nUsing browser development tools, verify that the computed font is one of the expected Main*FontforIBM fonts, where the weight matches that of the previously used font-face.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"8bd23053f639ae6cb384871845962b9d","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":85},"frontmatter":{"title":"Replacing font-faces in SPM"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Replacing font-faces in SPM\n---\n\nIf you use Social Program Management font-faces in your CSS, you must complete the following manual steps to update the font-faces.\n\n## Documentation ID\n\n259811\n\n## Version Hop\n\nTo v8.0\n\n## Component\n\nCore and Multiple Other Components\n\n## How to tell if you are affected\n\nCustomers using SPMs font-faces in their CSS are affected by this migration.
