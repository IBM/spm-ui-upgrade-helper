These will be the folders that the tool will work on i.e. your input data folder, plus an output data folder where it will write the modified data.\n\n1. Open Docker Desktop.\n2. Click Settings > Resources > File Sharing.\n3. Share your input data folder(s)\n4. Share a temporary output folder, e.g. `/tmp/upgrade` or `c:\\temp\\upgrade`\n    - Note that the output folder will be wiped by the SPM UI Upgrade Helper, so be careful! Do NOT point this at your v8 development environment.\n\n![1. Open Docker Desktop, 2. Click the Settings button then Resources then File Sharing, 3.
